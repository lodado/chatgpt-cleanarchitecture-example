## Introduction

make it for fun!

This project is structured following the principles of React Clean Architecture. It emphasizes separation of concerns, enabling the development of highly maintainable, scalable, and testable software. The project also incorporates Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) practices to ensure that the software meets the required specifications.

apps/: This directory contains the main application files like App.tsx and App.css.

entities/: This directory contains the business entities that are at the core of the application. For example, the task entity is defined here.

feature/: This directory contains the application features. Each feature has its own directory, like to-do-list, which further contains its model (including repository), use case, and UI 
(including adapter).

shared/: This directory contains shared code that can be used across different parts of the application. For example, it includes a error directory for error handling.

main.tsx: This is the main entry point of your application.



## Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

BDD is used to create clear and understandable requirements that guide the development process. The `gherkin.txt` file contains scenarios written in Gherkin syntax, which describe the behavior of the system from the user's perspective.

### Example Gherkin Scenario:

```gherkin
Feature: To-Do List Management

  Scenario: Add a new task to the To-Do list
    Given I have an empty To-Do list
    When I add a new task with title "Buy groceries"
    Then the To-Do list should contain 1 task
    And the task should have the title "Buy groceries"

  Scenario: Delete a task from the To-Do list
    Given I have a To-Do list with a task titled "Buy groceries"
    When I delete the task with title "Buy groceries"
    Then the To-Do list should be empty

  Scenario: Mark a task as completed
    Given I have a To-Do list with a task titled "Buy groceries"
    When I mark the task "Buy groceries" as completed
    Then the task "Buy groceries" should be marked as completed

  Scenario: Toggle task completion status from incomplete to completed
    Given I have a To-Do list with a task titled "Buy groceries" that is incomplete
    When I toggle the task completion status for the task "Buy groceries"
    Then the task "Buy groceries" should be marked as completed

  Scenario: Toggle task completion status from completed to incomplete
    Given I have a To-Do list with a task titled "Buy groceries" that is completed
    When I toggle the task completion status for the task "Buy groceries"
    Then the task "Buy groceries" should be marked as incomplete
```

## Clean Architecture Overview

The project is organized into several layers according to Clean Architecture principles, as detailed in the `cleanArchitecture.txt` file:

1. **Entity Layer**: This contains the business entities that are at the core of the application. These entities encapsulate the business rules and are independent of the application layers.
2. **Use Case Layer**: This layer contains the application-specific business rules. It orchestrates the flow of data to and from the entities, calling the required repositories and managing the logic for each use case.
3. **Repository Layer**: This layer provides an abstraction over the data access logic. It interacts with external systems, such as databases or web services, and is responsible for converting data between the external format and the application's entities.
4. **Adapter Layer**: This is the interface between the application and the outside world, including user interfaces, external APIs, and databases.

## Implementation Details

### Entity Layer

Entities are the core business objects, and they are defined in the `entity.txt` file. Each entity represents a concept within the business domain, and they are designed to be independent of any particular technology or framework.

### Use Case Layer

Use cases define the application-specific business rules. They manage the interaction between the repository layer and the entities. The `usecase.txt` file provides examples of how use cases are implemented, ensuring that the business rules are followed strictly.

### Repository Layer

Repositories provide an abstraction over data access. The repository implementations are designed to work with various data sources while keeping the use cases agnostic of the underlying data storage mechanism. The `repository.txt` file gives examples of repository patterns and their usage.

### Adapter Layer

Adapters are responsible for transforming data between the format used by the application and the format used by external systems. This layer ensures that changes in external systems have minimal impact on the core business logic.

## Error Handling

Error handling in the project is done meticulously, ensuring that each layer handles its specific errors while propagating them upwards in a controlled manner. The `error.txt` file contains classes for different types of errors, such as `EntityError`, `RepositoryError`, `UseCaseError`, and `AdapterError`.

### Example of Error Handling:

```typescript
function repositoryErrorExample() {
  try {
    const result = await request();
  } catch (error) {
    throw mapRepositoryErrorToUseCaseError(error);
  }
}
```

Each layer should map errors from the layer below to its specific error type before throwing it upwards.

## Testing with Jest (not implemented)

Testing is an integral part of the development process. This project uses Jest for testing, focusing primarily on the business logic (use cases) while minimizing the dependency on external systems. The `jest.txt` file provides guidelines and examples for writing tests.

### Example Jest Test:

```javascript
describe('User Login Use Case', () => {
  it('should login successfully with valid credentials', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const userCredentials = { username: 'testuser', password: 'password123' };
    
    // Act
    const result = await loginUseCase.execute(userCredentials);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

## Code Documentation (not implemented)

All code in the project is documented using JSDoc. This ensures that every function, class, and method is well-documented, facilitating easier maintenance and understanding of the codebase. The `jsdoc.txt` file provides examples and guidelines on how to write JSDoc comments.

### Example JSDoc Comment:

```typescript
/**
 * Logs a user into the system.
 * 
 * @param {Object} params - The login parameters.
 * @param {string} params.username - The username of the user.
 * @param {string} params.password - The password of the user.
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} The result of the login operation.
 * @throws {UseCaseError} If the login fails.
 */
async function login(params: { username: string, password: string }): Promise<Object> {
  // Implementation here
}
```

## About Clean Architecture Bot V2

https://chatgpt.com/g/g-gkaRrpV1f-clean-architecture-bot-v2


you can use GPTs here (You might need to subscribe to ChatGPT to access it, not me)


Clean Architecture Bot V2 (that's me!) is a specialized version of OpenAI's GPT-4 architecture, designed to assist with implementing and documenting software following Clean Architecture principles. I am trained to help with:


- Translating requirements into BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) specifications.
- Implementing code according to Clean Architecture.
- Writing detailed documentation and comments using JSDoc.
- Providing comprehensive test cases using Jest.
- Ensuring that error handling is done correctly across different layers of the architecture.

### Creator Feedback

- GPT excels at analysis but seems to be less strong in generation tasks.
- While it does a good job of writing interfaces, the detailed implementation often leaves something to be desired, requiring multiple iterations to refine the requirements.
- Still, it's quite useful for automating the most tedious parts of creating a Clean Architecture, like interface creation and documentation.
